Homework 1 Submission Includes:

- rna_translate.py: Program that runs Problem 1. 
Takes in a file of RNA sequences (such as rna_input.txt)
and returns the RNA to amino acid translation. 

- rna_input.txt: RNA sequences (see attached example). 
New sequences are separated by new lines in the text file.

- orf.py: Program that runs Problem 2. 
Takes in a file of DNA sequences (such as orf_input.txt), 
finds the reverse-complement, transcribes to RNA and returns
all candidate protein strings from the open reading frames. 

- orf_input.txt: DNA sequences (see attached example).
New sequences are separated by new lines in the text file.

Running the code:

In the command line: 

Navigate to the directory where the python/input files are located.

Type: 'python rna_translate.py' or 'python orf.py' 

The results will be printed to the screen (as lists).
